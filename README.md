# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview 
A fictitious company named Pewlett Hackard wants to calculate the turn over for the oncoming "silver tsunami". Which is where the aging older generation will be reaching retirement. For some companies this can leave them drastically understaffed until they can find replacements. Pewlett Hackard wnats to figure out how many roles will have turn over in the next few years. Another way they wish to prepare for this is to see how many of these soon to retire employees would be good candidates to "mentor" these new hires. That way the new hires have the tools and knowledge nessary for a smooth transition.

## Summary

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

(Employees retiring per job title)

At an initial glance it does not seem like there are that many roles that will need to be replaced. However the total is quite eye opening. The total of retiring employees in the nexrt upcoming years is 72,458. The company has a little over 300,000 employees, having about a third of the workforce leaving would leave the company in a very uneasy situtation.  

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

When you open the mentor_eligibility.csv file it shows that 1,941 employees qualify for these mentorship roles. In order for the company to fill the 72,458 roles that would require for each mentor to have 37 mentees. It would be dificult to convince an employee that's wanting to retire to take on a part time position where they are mentoring 37 new hires. That theoreticelly would be the work load of another full time position. A reasonable of mentees per part time mentor would be roughly 10-15. The amount of mentors needed to adequately cover that could ranfe between 4,500 - 7,000. Which is a significant difference from the current 1,941. 

Hopefully this analysis will give a good insight on what will need to be prepared for the turnover of the "silver tsunami".
